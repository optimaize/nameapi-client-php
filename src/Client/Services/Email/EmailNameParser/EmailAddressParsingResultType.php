 * technical (eg hostmaster@example.com).
 *
 * INITIALS
 * The email address contains a person's initials such as ab@example.com.

 * The email address contains a person's name such as john.doe@example.com.
 *

 * The email address uses a pseudonym as the user name such as maverick1986@example.com or happyhippo@example.com.
 *
 * NOT_A_NAME
 * There is no name in the address, for example x2000@example.com
 * <p>The address may be personal or non-personal, can't say (as in UNKNOWN)
 * but it is clear that no name can be found in it.</p>
 *
 * UNKNOWN
 * The email address could not be classified and hence the service failed to extract a name.
