/**
 * Class DisputeType
 *
 * Possible values are:
 *
 * GENDER
 * The gender of the name, as it was interpreted, contradicts the gender of the input person.
 * Either the person was entered with a gender (male or female), and the name is used for the
 * other gender. For example female Daniel.
 * Or the Gender was found in the name itself, such as "Mr. Daniela Johnson", and contradicts the
 * name.
 *
 * There are 3 possibilities here.
 * 1) the gender is wrong (or the gender-specific term like salutation "Mr.")
 * 2) the gender is right, but the name is misspelled (eg Daniel instead of Daniela, or Karim instead of Karin)
 * 3) all input is correct, but the system thinks otherwise because it doesn't know that name in that
 *    culture yet. For example a Turkish name could be neutral, but is stored as male, and therefore
 *    says for the female person the gender contradicts.
 *
 * SPELLING
 * The input name is, as it was interpreted, spelled incorrectly.
 * There are 2 possibilities here.
 * 1) the input name is misspelled
 * 2) the input name is correctly spelled, but is rare (more rare than the misspelling) or not known by the system.
 *
 * TRANSPOSITION
 * Aka swapped names, eg gn in sn field and vice versa.
 * @since 5.3
 *
 * TERM_INTERPRETATION
 * When a term is interpreted as something, but it would be much more likely to have another meaning.
 * Example: "Theodor" interpreted as surname.
 * @since 5.6
 *
 * DUPLICATE_CONTENT
 * EG the surname appears [Peter Smith, Smith] or the title [Dr, Dr John, Smith]
 * @since 5.3
 *
 * SYNTAX
 * When the string is syntactically broken and needs a fix, eg comma or dot in the wrong place, spacing errors.
 * @since 5.3
